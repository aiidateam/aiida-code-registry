#### NOTE

The hostname of the computer maybe different depend on the proxy host provide by paratera.
If the username is `<user>@<location>` then the user's aiida scratch directory should be setting to `/PARA/<user>/aiida`.
For example, if the username to login to the server is `pp00@GZ` the user directory after login would be seems like `/PARA/pp00/`.
